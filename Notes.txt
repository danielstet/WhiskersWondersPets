This the summary and notes that I made for the project

-- Bonus Features --
1) Login system (Authorizatiuon and Identities)
2) NLog implemintation
3) Sweet Alert (Like toast popups)
4) I tried to implement Auth02, couldnt really get it, most likely because of lack of understaing how Identites works under the hood
5) Unit testing with Moq FrameWork


-- Additional Technologies --

Front End:
Tailwind (CDN) - for css instead of BootStrap
SweetAlert2 - for toast pop ups

BackEnd:
